REMIX IDE remix.ethereum.org\
Compile these .sol files in this IDE

Truffle IDE helps in making Dapps (Blockchain Server ready)
ex. ballot1
truffle init ,cmpile, migrate, develop.

Can create web app and connect that with blockchain Server
App.js is webapp file and connected with .sol contracts
Need to use METAMASK to act as a bridge between web server and blockchain server
